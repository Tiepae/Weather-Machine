# Weather-Machine
A fun project that brings together programming concepts and hands-on hardware by using an Arduino Uno Rev 3.

I wanted to branch out from writing programs purely in an IDE and start combining software with physical hardware. The initial inspiration came from an electrical engineering class I took in high school, where we built circuits on breadboards and created different lighting configurations. I always enjoyed that hands-on work and wanted to revisit it.

To get back into it, I ordered a breadboard, an ohm reader, and a soldering iron to refresh my skills. After spending time tinkering with the practice components, I decided to integrate some of the programming fundamentals I’ve been learning into a hardware project. I picked up a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor for readings, an I2C LCD to display the data, and an Arduino Uno Rev 3 to bring everything together.

Throughout the project, I learned more about wiring, component compatibility, and the basics of the Arduino environment. Since Arduino is built on a C++-style language and my main focus has been C, this felt like a great opportunity to branch out and apply what I already know while picking up new skills along the way.

Eventually, I plan to explore running fully custom C programs on an Arduino without relying on the Arduino-specific language and framework.

Here are the components I used displayed below:
